She doesn't want to be a sex symbol, she does not want people talking about her dating life, or with whom she might be&nbsp;doing the deed. She just wants to be left alone so she can sing and sell records, both of which she does&nbsp;extremely well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But here's the thing-&nbsp;people want to know. Taylor has given herself a totally squeaky clean image, and to be fair, maybe it is not really an image, maybe she actually is squeaky clean. But either way, the more that she seems like the typical good girl, the more her fans and the media want to know about who she is dating, and also with whom she is doing the deed. It's just how it goes, really, in our pop culture-obsessed world. Also, she tends to go for guys who are bad boys, at least a little bit, and that just makes the story a little bit more appealing for everyone else, too. Oh, and I forgot one more important thing... Taylor is hot. None of the other stuff would really matter if she was just a talented singer with a clean public image, but the fact of the matter is, Taylor has more than a bit of a smolder going on underneath it all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, sorry Taylor, we know you hate stuff like this, but we are going to do it anyway. We still love you, though- maybe you'll be flattered by our attention. We can hope so, at least. In any event, here are&nbsp;15 things you didn't know about Taylor Swift's love&nbsp;life.</p><h2 id=15-she-rebounds-from-a-breakup-fast><strong>15. She Rebounds From A Breakup Fast</strong></h2><p>So we all know that our girl just had an awful breakup with <a href=#>Calvin Harris</a>. In the past that might have put her in a really bad spot both personally and with the media. She would have spent a long time licking her wounds. But not anymore. She has been hanging with <a href=#>Tom Hiddleston</a>&nbsp;and apparently things are moving along fast. According to&nbsp;an&nbsp;article&nbsp;in Eonline she and Hiddleston are already chatting up the whole kid thing. The article says: "This is the kind of a man she would want to marry," the source said. "She has said he would make a great dad. They have talked about what they want in the future and kids are something that they would both like down the line. They have very real and serious conversations about life." That sounds like a good plan Taylor- just make sure you invite us to the wedding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-she-doesn-t-want-to-be-a-sex-symbol><strong>14. She Doesn't Want To Be A Sex Symbol</strong></h2><p>Taylor once said in an&nbsp;interview&nbsp;with Access Hollywood that she did not see herself as a sex symbol. She said: "It's fine. I've accepted it. I'm a lot of things. Overtly sexy is not one of them. I'm fine. I'm fine with all the other things I am." She went on to say&nbsp;"As an artist you should embrace what comes naturally to you, whatever role feels right. I would never encourage an artist to try to fit in to a role that seemed to be created for them by a bunch of record label guys in suits in a conference room. I think for me it feels very natural to talk to teenagers and people my age… about feelings and what they're going through and their insecurities." &nbsp;You don't quite get it though, Taylor. The fact that you are so sexy and don't think that you are is kind of exactly what makes you so sexy in the first place. Sorry to be the one to break that to you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-don-t-grope-her-or-get-ready-to-pay><strong>13. Don't Grope Her Or Get Ready To Pay</strong></h2><p>It probably goes without saying at this point that a woman like Taylor does not want to be groped. What might not go without saying, though, is that if you do grope her that she will sue your butt off. A DJ once allegedly grabbed her butt backstage at a meet and greet- that&nbsp;started a chain of events that caused Taylor to sue. The moral of the story is that if you see Taylor, don't grab her butt, no matter how much you want to. Just don't do it! If you think she screws around, check <a href=#>this</a> out that was originally posted in Radaronline.&nbsp;The documents state that her goal in filing a lawsuit “will demonstrate that Mueller alone was the perpetrator of the humiliating and wrongful conduct targeted against Ms. Swift, and will serve as an example to other women who may resist publicly reliving similar outrageous and humiliating acts. For this reason, any recovery obtained by Ms. Swift will be donated to charitable organizations dedicated to protecting women from similar acts of sexual assault and personal disregard.” All we can say to that is "You go girl."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-she-didn-t-want-to-hang-out-with-orlando-bloom-after-all><strong>12. She Didn't Want To Hang Out With Orlando Bloom After All</strong></h2><p>There was all this stuff out there for a while about Taylor Swift and <a href=#>Orlando Bloom</a>. Which I guess makes sense, considering that they both are such enormous stars and supposedly he was sending her text messages. One of Taylor's friends said&nbsp;"Orlando has been bombarding Taylor with text messages and phone calls, begging her for a date. But she's been playing hard to get. She's flattered because she thinks Orlando is so sexy and, in normal circumstances, she would leap at the chance." Okay, one of her friends said that? Taylor, we hate to tell you, but you have a spy in your camp. You and I both know that she doesn't want her friends talking to the press about this kind of thing. Anyway, despite all of Mr. Bloom's overtures, nothing ever happened, even though there was a lot in the press about them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-she-felt-shamed-into-being-single><strong>11. She Felt Shamed Into Being Single</strong></h2><p>Notice that this is all put into past tense? The key word here is "felt" shamed into being single and not "feels" shamed into being single; we've already established that she has something going on right now with a certain Mr. Hiddleston. In the past, though, she felt that way and talked about the fact that everyone talked about her at length to the media. She said&nbsp;this:&nbsp;"It’s kind of a sad way I got there, though, being shamed into it. What else is it when you have two boyfriends in one year and everyone’s calling you boy crazy, making jokes about you at awards shows? That’s public humiliation. And I don’t think it’s fair." Well, let's be honest Taylor, none of it is fair. It isn't fair that people are always talking about you, but it also isn't fair that a lot of people live in crushing poverty. Sometimes it's hard to have it both ways.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-don-t-ask-her-about-men><strong>10. Don't Ask Her About Men</strong></h2><p>This sort of falls in line with the previous part of the article but Taylor has been known to get irritated when her sex and dating life have been brought up in interviews. She is cool to talk about her music, her tours, or any other project she has going on, but if one asks her about her personal life she gets a bit uptight. I understand this, I really do, I mean who wants that kind of thing to happen who&nbsp;is not named Kardashian??? At the same time,&nbsp;maybe Taylor just has to understand a few things. She is one of the very biggest stars in the entire world and she is hot. People are going to want to know about her. If I were her I would just get married and start popping out kids 'cause that's pretty much the only way that people will stop asking.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-no-matter-how-bad-you-want-to-don-t-picture-her-in-the-buff><strong>9. No Matter How Bad You Want To, Don't Picture Her&nbsp;In The Buff</strong></h2><p>Taylor has said:&nbsp;“It’s fine to talk about love publicly, but I think when you talk about virginity and sex publicly, people just automatically picture you naked, and as much as I can prevent people picturing me naked, I’m going to.” Once again, Taylor, you just don't get it. See, just right now I was not picturing you naked. Then I read a quote from you about how much you don't want people to picture you naked, which of course makes me picture you naked. In fact, right now there are probably thousands of people picturing you naked, purely because you said something about how much you did not want people to picture you naked. This is not rocket science Taylor! Anyway, I am distracted all of a sudden for some reason, so I think I am going to move forward to the next item on the list. Once I finish picturing Taylor naked, that is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-harry-styles-dumped-her-because-she-was-too-into-kissing><strong>8. Harry Styles Dumped Her Because She Was Too Into Kissing</strong></h2><p>Taylor went out with <a href=#>Harry Styles</a> for a while before she got dumped by him. Supposedly one of the reasons was "all she wanted to do was kiss." Now one can take this one of two ways. One can take it that Taylor just wanted to make out all the time and it drove Harry crazy, but we doubt that is what it meant. The other way we can take it is that when he said, "all she wants do is kiss," he really meant that is&nbsp;all&nbsp;she wanted to do, and did not want to go any further. If that is the case, we feel bad for Harry, that must have been truly frustrating. Because, come on, who would not want to go further with Taylor Swift? Of course, we also feel bad for Taylor in this instance, because once again it seems like she got a little embarrassed and called out by the press for being too good.</p><h2 id=7-calvin-harris-and-a-massage-parlor-may-have-led-to-their-demise><strong>7. Calvin Harris And A Massage Parlor May Have Led To Their Demise</strong></h2><p>Taylor was going out with Calvin Harris for quite a long while. When they broke up it was rumored that it was partly because of Harris getting a massage at a Thai place, which immediately conjured up thoughts of the good old "Happy ending" that is so common at such places. The thing is, though, supposedly the place he went just actually gave massages, with no real ending, happy or otherwise. &nbsp;That must really be a drag about being a celebrity. You go to get a massage; a good old regular, normal massage, and all of a sudden your face is all over the media with people thinking you did something wrong and Taylor Swift broke up with you for it. Oh, now that I think of it, if you just read the headline so I kind of did the exact same thing. Sorry Calvin, my bad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-she-and-calvin-harris-were-getting-it-on><strong>6. She And Calvin Harris Were &nbsp;Getting It On</strong></h2><p>Apparently Taylor and Calvin liked to get it on. According to <a href=#>this article</a> a source said: "[Calvin] comes over and they will stay up talking, and may even start watching a movie–but things get steamy pretty quickly. Neither one of them are getting much sleep as they stay up till 4, 5 in the morning getting it on. If they don’t have work they sleep in, eat and then go at it some more.” Okay, now, this seems to be exactly the type of thing that Taylor hates. They stay up until 4 or 5 in the morning getting in on? &nbsp;So now all of a sudden people are talking about her sex life&nbsp;and&nbsp;probably picturing her naked- all at the same time. If you have not been paying attention that pushes all of Taylor's buttons. But as far as Calvin goes, good on you Calvin, good on you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-she-bought-all-the-naughty-sites-related-to-her-name><strong>5. She Bought All The Naughty&nbsp;Sites Related To Her Name</strong></h2><p>This stands to reason considering what we have been writing about for awhile now. If you have not figured it out yet, she does not like people using her, or her image, for sexual purposes. Taylor went out and bought all of the different sites that people might have been able to use to put up adult sites about her. So if you were planning on starting something called "TaylorSwiftdoesyournamehere.com,"&nbsp;chances are that you won't be able to buy it. Unless, of course, you have a very unusual name. Taylor is nothing if not consistent. She does everything that she can to make sure that stuff like this does not get out there about her, which is of course exactly why stuff like this gets out there. &nbsp;Sorry Taylor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-there-are-lots-of-fake-photos-of-her-out-there><strong>4. There Are Lots Of Fake Photos&nbsp;Of Her Out There</strong></h2><p>One of the weird, and ultimately kind of gross things about the Internet, is how people can just sort of do what they want with your image if you are famous. Sadly for Taylor, and I do mean that, there are all sorts of fake images of her out there that show what appears to be her naked doing all sorts of things that I am sure she does not want to be seen doing. These, of course, are fake images that have been manipulated by people to make her appear to be posing nude or doing the deed, and they do look very real. This is the kind of thing that makes me get why she feels the way she does about all of this, though, as the whole thing really has to be a drag.</p><h2 id=3-jake-gyllenhaal-pulled-her-v-card><strong>3. Jake Gyllenhaal Pulled Her "V-Card"</strong></h2><p>Taylor, as most of you know, lost her virginity to <a href=#>Jake Gyllenhaal</a>. Not too long after that he bailed on her birthday party and really bummed her out. But seriously Taylor, what were you thinking? We all knew Jake was going to hurt you, and bailing on your birthday party??? What is this, your real life or a remake of&nbsp;16 Candles? What I never get is how people like this get all bummed about the media digging up dirt on them all the time, but then all they ever do is hang out with other famous people. Taylor, I have a pro tip for you; if you do not want the media all over you all the time, then instead of giving your V-card to a big movie star, maybe you should have gone out with someone that works at a cell phone kiosk at the mall. People probably would not have cared so much then.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-the-only-people-with-dirty-pics-of-her-are-her-female-friends><strong>2. The Only People With Dirty Pics Of Her Are Her Female Friends</strong></h2><p>So the word is that <a href=#>Cara Delevingne</a> really likes to steal Taylor Swift's cell phone and take photos of her chest. Well, okay, she just did this once, and it was made into a&nbsp;big deal so people like me could put it in stories such as this. But I digress. This to me seems like a true case of discrimination. I mean, I imagine that if I stole Taylor's phone and took photos of her chest, then I would probably be humiliated and locked up in some local county jail. But when Cara does it, no one cares. I am joking, of course. Also, if you are going to have a woman steal your phone and take photos of her breasts, who better to do it than Cara, an English fashion model who is truly gorgeous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-she-has-some-clothes-from-a-sex-shop><strong>1. She Has Some Clothes From A Sex Shop</strong></h2><p>According to&nbsp;sources,&nbsp;when Taylor did a shoot for the video for "Bad Blood," she and her crew borrowed $13,000 worth of clothes from a sex shop and she kept $5000 worth of the clothes after the shoot. According to the article, Shawn Gentry, the store's director of operations, says everything worn in the video will be available online, and he also noted that no toys or "pleasure items" were borrowed along with the clothing. Okay, Taylor, once again this is simply not the best way to stay out of the media with this type of thing. But, after writing this article, is seems to me that she has a bit of a love/hate thing after all with all of this attention. Gossip and rumors about hooking up sell records, and that is the business that she is in after all.</p><p><strong>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>eonline</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmptXam1qrrGrGSyp6Visaqwza1kpKafrHqirs6uq2aska65sL6MrK6inqSoeq271Z5kpaGWmnw%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2f15-things-you-didnt-know-about-taylor-swifts-love-life.html&title=15%20Things%20You%20Didn%27t%20Know%20About%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20Love%20Life" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-things-you-didnt-know-about-taylor-swifts-love-life.html&description=15%20Things%20You%20Didn%27t%20Know%20About%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20Love%20Life" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-things-you-didnt-know-about-taylor-swifts-love-life.html&title=15%20Things%20You%20Didn%27t%20Know%20About%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20Love%20Life" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2f15-things-you-didnt-know-about-taylor-swifts-love-life.html&title=15%20Things%20You%20Didn%27t%20Know%20About%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20Love%20Life" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2f15-things-you-didnt-know-about-taylor-swifts-love-life.html&text=15%20Things%20You%20Didn%27t%20Know%20About%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20Love%20Life" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2f15-things-you-didnt-know-about-taylor-swifts-love-life.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Jenniffer Sheldon</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-05-22</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./brittany-bristow-boyfriend-husband-wiki-bio.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Brittany Bristow Boyfriend, Dating, Husband, Movies, TV Shows, Net Worth, Wiki</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./formula-one-f1-drs-explained.html><h3>What is DRS and why does the device raise criticism? >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
