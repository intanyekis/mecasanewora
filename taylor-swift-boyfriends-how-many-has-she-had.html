The only difference is that Swift's relationships play out publicly rather than privately.</p><p>While Swift does not speak about her romances with any frequency, she does put them in her songs. Be it for being in love, heartbreak, and everything in between, Swift's <strong><a href=#>music</a></strong> is how she processes the emotions she has for the men she loves or loved, as seen by the songs <a href=#>Swift sings that leave her in tears on stage</a>. Swift puts her all into her relationships and allows herself to fall in love unapologetically.

This is clear by the fact that they are not referenced in any songs, as those who have been linked to Swift know all too well that they likely will be on an album down the road, which is not only cathartic for Swift but allows fans a glimpse into what made some relationships work and what caused them to end.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-has-had-12-confirmed-boyfriends>Taylor Swift Has Had 12 (Confirmed) Boyfriends</h2><h3 id=from-her-teenage-years-through-her-thirties-taylor-swift-has-had-12-high-profile-boyfriends>From her teenage years through her thirties, Taylor Swift has had 12 high-profile boyfriends</h3><p>The world started paying attention to who Swift was dating when she was 18 years old.

You have to forget about what everyone else thinks. It has to be an us-against-the-world mentality. You have to make it work by prioritizing it, and by falling in love really fast, without thinking too hard.
